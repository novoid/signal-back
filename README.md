# signal-back

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/xeals/signal-back.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xeals/signal-back)

In version 4.17.5, the Signal Android app introduced encrypted backups. While these are undoubtedly a security benefit over unencrypted backups, they do present an issue in being read into other systems or simply by their owner.

`signal-back` is intended to use the same decryption process as the Signal app uses when importing its backups, to make them readable without being used by the app.

# Usage

Either [build from source](#building-from-source) or download a [pre-built binary](https://github.com/xeals/signal-back/releases) and put the executable somewhere you can find it.

```
Usage: signal-back COMMAND [OPTION...] BACKUPFILE

  --help, -h                show help
  --log FILE, -l FILE       write logging output to FILE
  --password PASS, -p PASS  use PASS as password for backup file
  --pwdfile FILE, -P FILE   read password from FILE
  --version, -v             print the version

Commands:
  format   Read and format the backup file
  analyse  Information about the backup file
  extract  Retrieve attachments from the backup
  help     Shows a list of commands or help for one command
```

The current interface is by no means complete or stable and may change in the future.

Current export formats are:
- XML: (hopefully) Compatible with [SMS Backup & Restore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore); however, there may be issues.
- CSV

CSV supports MMS export, and XML is planned.

# Password

The password you need to decrypt the content of the Signal backup file was shown to you by Signal when you enabled local backups [similar to this screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8427572/36796616-d9560ee6-1c9d-11e8-8440-99e7f5f2ee03.JPG). It consists of six groups of five digits.

You can enter the password in the interactive dialog such as `12345 12345 12345 12345 12345 12345` or you can write it in a text file and pass it to signal-back using `-P password.txt`. 

# Example usage

Download whichever binary suits your system from the [releases page](https://github.com/xeals/signal-back/releases); Windows, Mac OS (`darwin`), or Linux, and 32-bit (`386`) or 64-bit (`amd64`). Checksums are provided to verify file integrity.

Find where you downloaded the file and open an interactive shell (Command Prompt, Terminal.app, gnome-terminal, etc.). Make sure your `signal-XXX.backup` file is in the same folder.

## Decrypting

If you're on Windows:

```sh
signal-back_windows_amd64.exe format -f XML signal-XXX.backup > backup.xml
```

If you're on MacOS or Linux (where e.g., `OS` is `darwin` and `ARCH` is `amd64`):

```sh
chmod +x signal-back_OS_ARCH
./signal-back_OS_ARCH format -f XML signal-XXX.backup > backup.xml
```

Enter your 30-digit password at the prompt (with or without spaces, doesn't matter).

You can then copy `backup.xml` to your phone and restore it using SMS Backup & Restore.

## Extracting media

You can pull out all your attachment files from the backup such as images, videos, and PDFs.

If you're on Windows:

```sh
signal-back_windows_amd64.exe extract -o output signal-XXX.backup
```

If you're on MacOS or Linux (where e.g., `OS` is `darwin` and `ARCH` is `amd64`):

```sh
chmod +x signal-back_OS_ARCH
./signal-back_OS_ARCH extract -o output signal-XXX.backup
```

Everything will be in the `output` folder where you ran the command. Note that some files may have a `.unknown` extension; this is because `signal-back` might not be able to determine what these files are. However, they should still be completely valid files of some sort.

# Building from source

Building requires [Go](https://golang.org) and [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep). If you don't have one (or both) of these tools, instructions should be easy to find. After you've initialised everything:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/xeals/signal-back $GOPATH/src/github.com/xeals/signal-back
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/xeals/signal-back
$ dep ensure
$ go build .
```

You can also just use `go get github.com/xeals/signal-back`, but I provide no guarantees on dependency compatibility.
